## Fundamental macro based value of assets

The volume of trade in existing assets is proportional to the hypothetical
present value of claims on future real economic activity, represented by
the discounted sum of future GDP. The discount factor depends on the
hypothetical (unobservable) level of lending rates that would cover all
lending costs and (expected) risks

$$
\xyfwl_t = \left(1 - \tfrac{1}{c_0}\right) \left[\
y_t 
+ \tfrac{1}{(c_0 + c_1 \ \hat r^{\Delta full}_t) \ y^\mathrm{roc}_\xss} \ \ y_{t+1}
+ \cdots\
\right]
$$
